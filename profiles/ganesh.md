## Appeal
> Dear TFN Family,  
>  
> Teach For Nepal has been one of the most defining journeys of my life. From my fellowship in Sindhupalchok to serving as a School Manager, and now working in education leadership and sustainable development, I have always carried the values and purpose that TFN instilled in me. Like many of you, I know what it means to stand in front of a classroom with limited resources but unlimited hope, and to realize that change begins with us.  
>  
> I am standing as your Alumni Representative because I want our voices—our shared struggles, growth, and aspirations—to be heard at the highest level of TFN’s leadership. Alumni are the heartbeat of this movement, and I believe our stories and experiences should shape the direction of TFN’s future.  
>  
> What I bring is not only the passion of a Fellow but also the experience of managing schools, leading initiatives, and building partnerships that connect education with innovation and community. I want to serve as a bridge between fellows and alumni, between classrooms and the boardroom so that TFN continues to grow stronger, more inclusive, and more impactful.  
>  
> This is not just my candidacy—it is our shared journey as alumni. If elected, I commit to representing you with integrity, openness, and a long-term vision for educational equity in Nepal. I humbly ask for your trust and your vote. Together, we can continue to transform lives.  
>  
> With gratitude,  
> Ganesh Paudyal
