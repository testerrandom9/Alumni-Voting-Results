## Appeal
> Dear Fellow Alumni,  
>  
> Our journey as Fellows transformed not only our classrooms but also ourselves. Today, as we continue to work across different sectors, our alumni community carries immense potential to drive change beyond the fellowship. I am standing for the Alumni Representative position on the TFN Board to ensure that this collective potential is recognized, mobilized, and strengthened.  
>  
> I bring to this role my experiences as a 2015 Fellow, the Founding Vice-President of the Alumni Association, and my current professional work in child rights, gender equality, and youth empowerment. Having worked at both grassroots and national levels, I understand the power of collaboration and advocacy to influence systemic change.  
>  
> If elected, I commit to being a strong voice for alumni, to creating meaningful opportunities for engagement, and to ensuring that our collective experiences shape TFN’s decisions. Together, we can strengthen our alumni network as a community of changemakers supporting each other while continuing to advance equity and justice in Nepal.  
>  
> I humbly request your support and your vote. Let’s carry forward the spirit of our fellowship and keep the movement alive.  
>  
> Regards,  
> Rusha
