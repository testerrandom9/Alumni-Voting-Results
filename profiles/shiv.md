## Appeal
> Dear Fellow Alumni,  
>  
> I am honored to present my candidacy for Alumni Representative on the TFN Board. Each of us carries the spirit of Teach For Nepal in unique ways, and I believe our Alumni Association can become an even stronger platform for collective impact if we combine our experiences and dreams.  
>  
> My TFN journey began as a Fellow in Simley, Lalitpur, where I witnessed both the challenges and the possibilities of education in underserved communities. Since then, I have served as Documentation Coordinator, Treasurer of the Alumni Association, and Alumni Secretary for the Teach For All Asia-Pacific network—mobilizing thousands of alumni across borders to share, learn, and lead.  
>  
> Alongside these commitments, I have built ventures from scratch in Nepal, India, Dubai, the US, and Australia, including Meroghar.com, The Urban Space, Advik.ai, and Supertruck.ai. These companies collectively generate an average of 20 crore annually, and in the process, I have learned how to scale ideas sustainably, maintain accountability, and build trust with diverse stakeholders. My mission now is to create numerous global opportunities that combine scale, sustainability, and economic growth—a vision I also want to bring into how we strengthen the Alumni Association.  
>  
> If elected, I will work to amplify alumni voices, create sustainable structures for engagement, and open pathways for global opportunities that benefit both alumni and the communities we serve. With your support, we can carry forward the TFN spirit into a movement that is not only national but also global.

> In solidarity,
